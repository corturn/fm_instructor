# fm_instructor

This project is a monophonic frequency modulation (FM) synthesizer programmed in Max/MSP intended to be performed with a MIDI keyboard. With an easy-to-use visual GUI this synth functions as both a synth and FM learning/experimentation tool as the user can directly view how the modifying the modulator and carrier parameters affects their respective waves and the harmonics of the final sound.
